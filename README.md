# A Sample Voice Recorder Project

Hey! Using this we can record the audio from the user and then we can give an option to him/her to play it again and can download it in (.mp3) fromat. Also with this we can play an exsiting audio file from our pc by uploading it.

# how to run?

Just do an npm install and npm start for running it locally.

Cheers!
